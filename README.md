# 💬 Customer Feedback Management System

A Python-based system that allows a company to collect and analyze customer feedback. This system helps gather customer names, ratings, and detailed feedback and stores them for analysis using Python and basic data structures. The collected data is stored in a CSV file for further analysis and reporting.

## 🚀 Features

- **Collect Feedback**: Input customer names, ratings (1-5), and detailed feedback.
- **Store Data**: Automatically save customer feedback into a CSV file for future use.
- **Analyze Feedback**: Perform basic data analysis and categorize feedback (e.g., positive/negative).
- **Menu-Based System**: Interactive user menu for collecting and managing feedback.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Data Structures
- **`customer_names` (list)**: Stores the names of customers providing feedback.
- **`customer_ratings` (list)**: Stores the ratings (1-5) given by each customer.
- **`customer_feedbacks` (list)**: Stores the detailed feedback provided by customers.

### Functions
1. **`collect_feedback()`**: Collects feedback for a number of customers including name, rating, and feedback.
2. **`save_feedback_to_csv()`**: Saves all collected feedback to a CSV file.
3. **`analyze_feedback()`**: Analyzes the feedback based on keywords and categorizes it as positive or negative.
4. **`display_feedback()`**: Displays the feedback stored in the CSV file.
5. **`feedback_menu()`**: A command-line interface that offers options to collect, save, and analyze feedback.

## 💻 Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-feedback-system.git
   cd customer-feedback-system
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies** (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

3. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   python customer_feedback_system.py
   ```

4. **Interactive Menu**: 
   Once the program starts, an interactive menu will allow you to select from various operations such as collecting feedback, saving feedback to CSV, analyzing feedback, and more.

## 📝 Usage

1. **Collect Feedback**: Choose option `1`, then input customer details like name, rating, and feedback.
2. **Save to CSV**: Choose option `2` to save all collected feedback to a CSV file.
3. **Analyze Feedback**: Choose option `3` to analyze the feedback for sentiment (positive/negative).
4. **Display Feedback**: Choose option `4` to display stored feedback from the CSV file.
5. **Exit**: Choose option `5` to exit the program.

### Example

```plaintext
Customer Feedback Menu:
1. Collect Feedback
2. Save Feedback to CSV
3. Analyze Feedback
4. Display Feedback
5. Exit
Enter your choice (1-5): 1
Enter the customer's name: Jane Doe
Enter the rating (1-5): 5
Enter feedback: Excellent service, very good!
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language for the feedback system.
- **Pandas**: Used to save and read feedback data from a CSV file.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporate more advanced natural language processing (NLP) tools for more nuanced feedback categorization.
- **Data Visualization**: Add graphs and charts to visualize the feedback trends.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a simple web interface using Flask or Django for better user interaction.
